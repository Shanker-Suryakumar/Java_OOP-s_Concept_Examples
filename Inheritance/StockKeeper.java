package Inheritance;

/*
 * Letâ€™s say that the album shop we discussed also sells Blu-ray movies.
 * There are many common states and behaviors (common code) between Album and Movie.
 * This is where we use inheritance.
 * Inheritance is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the states and behaviors of a parent object.
 * Inheritance uses a parent-child relationship (IS-A relationship).
 * 
 * A class can extend only one class however it can implement any number of interfaces. 
 * An interface can extend more than one interfaces.
